            <h5>Stripe will automatically credit any Payout/Payment directly to your Stripe account after every successful transaction.Stripe will transfer funds to your bank account based on the schedule listed in your dashboard. For example, “Daily — 7 day rolling basis” would mean that charges processed on 1st March would be grouped together and deposited in your account on 8th March, and “Weekly (Monday) — 2 business day rolling basis” would mean that charges processed before a given Thursday will be grouped together and deposited in your account on the following Monday.Your transfer schedule can be configured to simplify your accounting. We currently offer the option for funds to be transferred daily, weekly (on a custom day of the week), or monthly (on a custom day of the month).You can see all attempted transfers made by Stripe to your bank account on your dashboard.</h5>
            
            <h4>Stripe states that a transfer has been submitted, but I have not received the money in my bank account yet. What is going on?</h4>
            <h5>Stripe submits transfers every day, but most banks will only process the transfer on business days. This means that if Stripe sent you money on a holiday or a weekend, you will probably only receive the money in your bank account on the next day that your bank is open. For transfers sent on business days, you should receive the money by the next day.If the transfer was submitted on a business day and you don’t receive the money in your bank account within a couple of days, this probably means that the transfer has failed. Banks take 3-5 business days to inform Stripe about transfers that failed to go through, at which time Stripe will e-mail you about the issue and how to fix it.</h5>
            
            <h4>What items are prohibited on Shootspace?</h4>
            <h5>This policy is part of our Terms of Use (insert link). By selling on Shootspace, you are agreeing to this policy and our Terms of Use. 
            Shootspace requires all sellers and users to abide by the laws of the jurisdictions in which you are operating and selling. If you are shipping items across international borders, we expect all members to follow the local laws of both the exporting and importing countries. 
            Therefore, even if an item is illegal in one country but legal in another, it would still be strictly prohibited in Shootspace. Shootspace does not allow any listing that through images or descriptions facilitate or promote illegal acts when applied under a specific context.
            Shootspace expects all users to only list items that are legal. All items must not present legal risks to our community, be inconsistent with Shootspace values or harmful to our members.</h5>
